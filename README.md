# Splashdown

**Splashdown** is the ultimate Markdown flavor!

* Splashdown has *improved* Github Flavored Markdown (GFM), or IGFM.
* Splashdown has MediaWiki ablities. Make templates with curly braces!
* Splashdown has LaTeX features! Do math (with MathJax) and chemistry (with mhchem)!
* Splashdown has UML features! (mermaid is nice, but PlantUML is better! Graphviz Dot support FTW!)

Splashdown will eventually support other features.
* Embed video as you would with links without needing to make a cover image. This can also be useful for audio.
* Text-to-Speech support for accessiblity (JavaScript can do that!)
* Drawings, graphs, charts, and more!
* Code preview (try out the code in your code blocks!)
* WYSIWYM?
